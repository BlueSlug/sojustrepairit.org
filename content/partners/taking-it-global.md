TakingITGlobal empowers youth to understand and act on the world's greatest challenges. Their free action guides, summer camps, and educator training help to engage students in deep learning through real-world problem solving. Through Connected North, TIG delivers culturally-relevant content to Canada's most remote communities, supporting Indigenous youth leadership and cultural exchange.

<h3 class="partner-heading">SJRK work</h3>

TakingITGlobal is focusing on developing inclusive and accessible youth action guides related to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The new guides will be based on a revision of their original youth action guides on the Millennial Development Goals, with added focus on inclusion and learning difference. TIG is also working on gathering and disseminating indigenous youth video stories from over 20 groups all over Canada, and will focus on an inclusive creation process as well as on creating accessible final works.
