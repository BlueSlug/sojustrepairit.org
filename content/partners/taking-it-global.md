## SJRK work

### Whose Land Videos 

Working in collaboration with Indigenous peoples across Turtle Island, the TIG team has helped to facilitate the creation of a series of videos which portray Indigenous perspectives about the importance of land and culture. Aiming to increase understanding of why land acknowledgements are important, and the way Indigenous people view their relationship to land, these videos complement a web-based app that uses GIS technology to assist users in identifying Indigenous Nations, territories, and Indigenous communities across Canada. The app consists of six different maps of Indigenous territories, Treaties, and First Nations, Inuit, and Metis communities. Each community's location will eventually host a land acknowledgement video, and other information that the community would like to include on their page. The app will be used as an educational tool to create dialogue around reconciliation. It will be a starting point for conversation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous citizens across this country about land, territorial recognition and land acknowledgement. Thus far, 8 videos have been created and posted to the page.


Through the SJRK project, the IDRC worked with TIG to support development of the initial concept of this community storytelling initiative. The pilot project has since been successfully scaled into a full project called CanCode which will entail working with 80 Indigenous youth from 40 communities to create community videos. The next step of engagement  with SJRK will focus on ensuring transcription content is available in Indigenous languages, some of which are considered to  be endangered.
