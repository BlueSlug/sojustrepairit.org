### SJRK work

James is working with youth organizations in Rwanda to document the stories and experiences of young people with learning differences, with an aim to map the barriers they face in accessing the formal education system. James will also work with young people to map out inclusion practices with the aim of promoting local inclusive design practices, processes, and approaches. The initiative will engage young people with learning differences and their parents and caregivers as well as representatives of youth-led organizations in Rwanda. For activities in Rwanda, James will collaborate with UWEZO, a Rwandan organization led by youth with disabilities, and the African Youth with Disabilities Network (AYWDN).
