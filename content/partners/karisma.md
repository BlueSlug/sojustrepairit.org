# [Fundaci&oacute;n Karisma (Karisma)](https://karisma.org.co/)

## About

Karisma is a Colombian civil society organization founded in 2003 to ensure that the benefits of technology reach those most in need, and that technological developments promote human rights. It approaches activism from both legal and technological angles, working in coalition with local, regional and international partners.

## SJRK work

The Karisma Foundation in Colombia has been working together with the Social Justice Repair Kit on a project named El Planeta es la Escuela (The Planet is the School). The motto of this project is to “learn, innovate and narrate the territory”, and includes the participation of youth groups in the rural area of Fresno (Tolima) as well as in the city of Medellin (Antioquia).

Following the objectives of the "Social Justice Repair Kit", this project is generating experiences that strengthen the relationship between youth groups and the territory to which they belong, through two strategies:

1. Exploring opportunities to create or innovate in the territory.
2. Gathering personal and collective stories to share experiences as young people, told from their own point of view.

For the Colombian writer William Ospina, it is urgent that educational processes have a purpose that is not reduced to individual success and profitability, but rather one that engenders a deep sense of dignity and community. This is possible when the education system makes space for thought, creativity, communication, socialization and happiness. If the "Planet is the school" our task is to learn, innovate and narrate the territory.

The project is being developed with two groups, the young women of the "Motivando a la Gyal Festival" of Platohedro (Medellín) and the students of the 9, 10 and 11th grades of the Colegio Real Campestre (Mireya and Las Marías, Fresno), with the addition of more schools in the region as the project develops.

## Project in Medellín:

"Motivating the Gyal*" is a festival that brings together young women from the city of Medellín to work around topics such as collaborative technologies, feminism, local food growing, social cartography, and more. Its second iteration took place in September 2018 with the support of the SJRK project.

Thanks to the support of the SJRK project, Motivando a la Gyal held a pre-launch event in August 2018, improving their social media platforms with self-developing content (illustrations, videos, audios) and also they had support for the logistic of the festival in September.

Also, Juliana Soto, from Karisma, presented a series of “maps” that she develop after listening the whatsapp audio messages that the young women of Motivando a la Gyal sent to her, answering a list of questions. The maps are a way to known the expectations, the dreams and all the “behind the scenes” of the group in Medellín, in an anonymous format.

## Project in Fresno: Opportunities for young coffee growers

The goal of this initiative is to support students in the last grades of high school in rural areas of Fresno, Tolima, Colombia. For them, it is a time when questions about the future (i.e. staying in the country or the possibility of going to the cities) begin to intensify. With “Opportunities for young coffee growers” Karisma designed a series of workshops that involve creativity, the possibilities of local entrepreneurship, and digital tools, we are seeking to amplify these questions and find possible ways to solve them through collaborative dynamics, while stressing the local context.

The project has 5 stages:

1. Tuning our stories.
2. Exploring opportunities in our territory.
3. Visits to local entrepreneurs and creative workshops\*\*
4. Developing projects
5. Final thoughts and reflections

In the spring of 2018 the students visited different places in town and close to town, including:

* Finca El Cámbulo - an organic farm
* Machine shop
* Touristic tour
* Beauty salon and barbershop

Karisma designed a [guide to develop those visits](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vGflyG6CjiCZdibAe5vvv_C0edTYDb0HmeKkKaIu23I/edit) (in Spanish).

The goal of the workshops was to give a creative, artistic and communicative channel to the visits related to entrepreneurship activities. For example, the first workshop was a drawing workshop led by Colombian artist Angélica Ramírez. Please see Angélica’s [report about the experience](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxjSZthgKovfSFhaX3dGSFlNNzh2czVPdXo4OVplZ0JGcy1V/view) (in Spanish) and the [presentation of the workshop](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxjSZthgKovfVlZjSldFRWo0Q1NuUk8tOE1wMC1RS3hQOXpV/view).

In June 2018 Karisma finished the workshops in Fresno with Natalia Mesa Parodi, a writer who led a workshop about reading aloud and written creation activities. [[Spanish report, include images](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ncmOntrI6daaIYIaiKgeBAJEvC9eNs-U/view)].

A key part of the project is the use of the Kimera Local Network (offline) and the Coffee Grower Network (online) to follow up the project.

More about the local network:

During the project, the KIMERA LOCAL NETWORK has been adapted and improved, using it in each of the venues of the Real Campestre School. The local network has been used to disseminate and to give participants access to information about local ventures and activities.

Additionally, it has allowed the documentation of the progress of the project and also, facilitated collaborative dynamics among the participants, including the diffusion and sharing of the storytelling videos, and the outcomes of the creative workshops.

As for the limited or null connectivity, internet access does not exist in practice at the schools. It is expected that this digital tool can be adjusted to the requirements of the central server in Canada and allows the integration of the local results with those of the central project in Canada and will share the contents and results of the central project in the different venues in Colombia.
