<h3 class="partner-heading">About</h3>

Karisma is a Colombian civil society organization founded in 2003 to ensure that the benefits of technology reach those most in need, and that technological developments promote human rights. It approaches activism from both legal and technological angles, working in coalition with local, regional and international partners.

<h3 class="partner-heading">SJRK work</h3>

Karisma will conduct surveys with four different youth organisations in order to determine their needs related to serving youth with learning differences. These organisations include both formal and informal/popular schools as well as hacker groups and community houses, with a focus on marginalised groups. First-person story gathering and dissemination will be a main component of this work. The surveys will be followed by co-design workshops, pilot delivery of tools, and evaluation.
