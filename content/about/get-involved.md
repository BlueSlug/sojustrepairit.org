## Get Involved

{{< heading-rule >}}

This project is being created through iterative cycles of co-design with youth and supporting organisations. We are seeking stories from youth with learning differences, or from those who have worked or want to work with youth with learning differences.

If you are interested in being involved, please get in touch! You can subscribe to our [mailing list](https://lists.idrc.ocadu.ca/mailman/listinfo/sojustrepairit) or collaborate with us on the [Fluid Project Wiki](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Social+Justice+Repair+Kit).
