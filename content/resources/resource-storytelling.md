## Storytelling

{{< heading-rule >}}

<p class="resource-intro">Sharing our personal narratives allows us to identify and build communities around our common experiences. Stories reveal issues that can spark and strengthen movements. How do we enable the gathering and sharing of stories from a wide diversity of people?</p>

### [Whose.Land](https://www.whose.land/en/)

Whose Land is a web-based app that uses GIS technology to assist users in identifying Indigenous Nations, territories, and Indigenous communities across Canada. The app can be used for learning about the territory your home or business is situated on, finding information for a land acknowledgement, and learning about the treaties and agreements signed across Canada. Educational videos are available to watch that will give you a better understanding of why land acknowledgements are important, and the way Indigenous people view their relationship to land.
