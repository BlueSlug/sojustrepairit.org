M.A.G. is a social platform created by a group of women from “El Valle de Aburrá”, the area that surrounds Medellín city in Colombia. Their main focus is organizing a collaborative, open and creative festival based in 3 themes:  sovereignty, technologies, and gender. The goal of the event is to create a space where thinkers, activists, children, mothers, and artists from different contexts can collaboratively build processes, effective (and affective) networks (that contribute in different ways in the remaking of our relations with the world), and advance our thinking in the importance of diversity. Currently available in Spanish.
