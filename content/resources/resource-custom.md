<p class="resource-intro">Digital design offers diverse possibilities for transformation and adaptation of learning content. How do we leverage these possibilities in envisioning, building and evolving tools to support diverse learning needs?</p>

### [Introduction to User Interface Options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63DqNgxtsrA)

This video provides an overview of the Fluid Project's User Interface Options (UIO) component, what it offers potential integrators, and its installation instructions. UIO allows users to personalize web content to meet their unique needs.

### [Preferences Exploration Tool](http://build.fluidproject.org/prefsEditors/demos/explorationTool/)

This tool allows for the exploration of digital preferences in a simple and low-risk way, by offering a set of starter preferences to try - from reading content aloud so it's easier to follow along, to enhancing keyboard interactions so it's easier to use.

### [Chart Authoring Tool](http://build.fluidproject.org/chartAuthoring/demos/)

The Chart Authoring Tool supports the authoring, export and embedding of highly accessible charts, including sonification of the data. The current version supports creating pie charts and transforming the data into sonified form via a pattern.

### [Nexus Integration Technology](https://wiki.gpii.net/w/Nexus_API)

The Nexus is a system that connects disparate technologies and enables new and inclusive interactions which can be used to visualize and sonify data as it is gathered. See how sensors commonly found in a science lab can be connected to accessible, sonified graphs in the [Nexus Science Lab Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNwc0VYRhUU&feature=youtu.be) from 2017. See a demonstration of the Nexus being used to inclusively create music using various inputs including a head tracker in the
[Nexus Inclusive Music Creation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R_pz2Fz4qE&feature=youtu.be) from 2016.

### [First Discovery Tool](https://build.fluidproject.org/first-discovery/demos/)

This tool walks the user through a step by step process of discovering, declaring and storing digital preferences.

### [Feedback and Metadata Tools](http://metadata.floeproject.org/demos/feedback/)

The metadata feedback tool can be integrated into existing sites to allow users to provide feedback as to whether a digital resource matched their preferences and to request alternatives or modifications to improve it. [The metadata authoring](https://metadata.floeproject.org/demos/metadata/) components can be integrated into existing content editors to encourage and allow authors to create or edit metadata that accompanies the content of their Open Education Resource (OER), thereby improving accessibility.
