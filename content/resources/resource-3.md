This video provides an overview of the Fluid Project's User Interface Options (UIO) component, what it offers potential integrators, and its installation instructions. UIO allows users to personalise web content to meet their unique needs.

### [Preferences Exploration Tool](http://build.fluidproject.org/prefsEditors/demos/explorationTool/)

This tool allows for the exploration of digital preferences in a simple and low-risk way, by offering a set of starter preferences to try - from reading content aloud so it's easier to follow along, to enhancing keyboard interactions so it's easier to use.

### [Chart Authoring Tool](http://build.fluidproject.org/chartAuthoring/demos/)

The Chart Authoring Tool supports the authoring, export and embedding of highly accessible charts, including sonification of the data. The current version supports creating pie charts and transforming the data into sonified form via a pattern.

### [First Discovery Tool](https://build.fluidproject.org/first-discovery/demos/)

This tool walks the user through a step by step process of discovering, declaring and storing digital preferences.

### [Feedback Tool](http://metadata.floeproject.org/demos/feedback/)

The metadata feedback tool can be integrated into existing sites to allow users to provide feedback as to whether a digital resource matched their preferences and to request alternatives or modifications to improve it.
