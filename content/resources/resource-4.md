The ValueAble Leader Project is an emerging digital toolkit designed to support young audiences (including those with learning differences) who want to better understand the importance of their individual values and the role those play when it comes to leadership. Leveraging inclusive-design practices, this resource was created in collaboration between the [Center for Creative Leadership](https://www.ccl.org/), [Oak Foundation](http://oakfnd.org/), and several other partners who helped to make it more accessible and enjoyable for a diverse range of users.
