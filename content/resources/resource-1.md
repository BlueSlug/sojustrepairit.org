### [Inclusive Making and Hacking](https://handbook.floeproject.org/InclusiveMakingAndHacking.html)
A guide to creating an inclusive space when hosting hack-a-thons. We believe that the connections and ideas that get made between people attending hackathons and similar events are more important than any products that get produced. If hackathons are about building community, issues of inclusion, exclusion and audience diversity are paramount to their design.

### [Motivando a la Gyal](http://motivandoalagyal.n-esima.net/)
M.A.G. is a social platform created by a group of women from “El Valle de Aburrá”, the area that surrounds Medellín city in Colombia. Their main focus is organising a collaborative, open and creative festival based in 3 themes:  sovereignty, technologies, and gender. The goal of the event is to create a space where thinkers, activists, children, mothers, and artists from different contexts can collaboratively build processes, effective (and affective) networks (that contribute in different ways in the remaking of our relations with the world), and advance our thinking in the importance of diversity.
