# Resources

{{< heading-rule >}}

These resources have been created and compiled by the partners of the Social Justice Repair Kit project and cover a wide range of subjects and contexts. They can be used by youth and youth organisations to support the inclusion of young people in social justice movements. Their aim is to support informal learning through activism.

Please bear with us as we work to make this library more usable! We will be adding a search feature and filters to help you find what you are looking for.

We welcome your feedback. Are these resources helpful? Do you have suggestions or contributions? [Let us know](https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Social+Justice+Repair+Kit#SocialJusticeRepairKit-JoinUsJoinUs).
