## Learning to Learn

{{< heading-rule >}}

<p class="resource-intro">We all learn differently. How can we develop greater understanding of our own learning styles and preferences, and learn to better understand the learning styles and preferences of others?</p>

### [Oak Foundation Learning Differences Program](http://oakfnd.org/our-learnings.html)

Oak’s Learning Differences Programme partnered with OpenSource Leadership Strategies to conduct a racial equity assessment of the LDP and to gather insights about the broader field of learning differences.  To inform the equity assessment, the LDP invited its current grantees to participate in a survey and the OpenSource analysed the findings, conducted interviews with more than a dozen leaders in the learning differences and racial equity fields and brought their own expertise and analysis to shape their assessment. [Sign up for our programme’s newsletter](http://oakfnd.org/learning-differences.html) to hear more resources as they are developed by our grantee partners.

### [Eye to Eye](https://eyetoeyenational.org/)

Eye to Eye is a mentoring program for students who have learning differences. It is a welcoming hand, ushering students with learning and attention issues into a community where they are helped to move from self-doubt to empowerment — and even their own version of greatness — by near-peers who face many of the same challenges themselves. 

An iPhone app, [Eye to Eye Empower](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eye-to-eye-empower-different-learners/id1192367658?mt=8), lets parents, children, teachers, or students create their own My Advocacy Plan (MAP).

### [Students LEAD](https://studentslead.fi.ncsu.edu/#!/pages/home)

[Students LEAD (Learn, Explore, & Advocate Differently)](https://www.fi.ncsu.edu/news/the-friday-institute-launches-first-of-its-kind-online-course-for-students/) was created because all students learn differently. The course was developed to help students, especially those who may struggle with attention, time management, memory, or expressing ideas, understand that they are not alone and that specific strategies can support their learning.
