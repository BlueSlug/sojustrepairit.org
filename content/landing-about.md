### About SJRK

{{< heading-rule >}}

The goal of the Social Justice Repair Kit project is to support youth at risk who have learning differences to re-engage in education through an inclusively designed social justice platform that integrates authentic project-based learning.

For youth with identified and unidentified learning differences, the Kit adds inclusive design supports to remove barriers to participation.
