            <h2 class="partner">Fundación Karisma (Karisma)</h2>
            <h3 class="partner-heading">About</h3>
            <p>Karisma is a Colombian civil society organization founded in 2003 to ensure that the benefits of

                and international partners.</p>
            <h3 class="partner-heading">SJRK work</h3>
            <p>Karisma will conduct surveys with four different youth organisations in order to determine their needs
                related to serving youth with learning differences. These organisations include both formal and
                informal/popular schools as well as hacker groups and community houses, with a focus on marginalised
                groups. First-person story gathering and dissemination will be a main component of this work. The
                surveys will be followed by co-design workshops, pilot delivery of tools, and evaluation.</p>
