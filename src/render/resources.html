    <h3>Tool Development in Progress</h3>

    <p><a href="https://build.fluidproject.org/sjrk-storyTelling/">Storytelling Tool</a><br />
    This digital tool is being developed as part of the SJRK project to gather and share stories of youth with learning differences, social justice organisations and others who wish to share their story or create a simple online presence.</p>

    <p><a href="http://build.fluidproject.org/prefsEditors/demos/explorationTool/">Preferences Exploration Tool</a><br />
    This tool allows for the exploration of digital preferences in a simple and low-risk way, by offering a set of starter preferences to try - from reading content aloud so it's easier to follow along, to enhancing keyboard interactions so it's easier to use.</p>

    <p><a href="http://build.fluidproject.org/chartAuthoring/demos/">Chart Authoring Tool</a><br />
    The Chart Authoring Tool supports the authoring, export and embedding of highly accessible charts, including sonification of the data. The current version supports creating pie charts and transforming the data into sonified form via a pattern.</p>

    <p><a href="https://metadata.floeproject.org/demos/metadata/">Metadata Authoring</a><br />
    The metadata authoring components can be integrated into existing content editors to encourage and allow authors to create or edit metadata that accompanies the content of their Open Education Resource (OER), thereby improving accessibility.</p>
