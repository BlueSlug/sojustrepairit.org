			<u>Karisma</u><br />
			Karisma is working on finding digital technology solutions for youth with identified and unidentified learning differences in Fresno, a small town in the coffee region of Colombia. Through projects such as <a href="https://fresnoposible.blogspot.ca/">“Fresno Posible” and “Real Campestre”</a>, the project is working with school teachers as well as with teenagers with learning differences to identify their learning needs and to identify and develop the technology that can support those needs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Karisma is also working in Medellin with <a href="http://platohedro.org/platohedro/">Platohedro</a>, a community house supporting children, teenagers and young people in order to keep them away from violence by building strong relations with the community. Projects include the development of a creative platform to promote art experimentation, knowledge sharing, and technology appropriation, as well as work with La Jaquer EsCool, an open hacker space. Through the SJRK project Karisma is working to co-create resources with these youth to support their individual learning needs in these environments.

			<u>Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM)</u><br />
			Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM) provides <a href="http://sitios.itesm.mx/prepanet/">online educational programs</a> that allow youth and adults to return to school. A major benefit of these programs is that they can be completed at home on a personalised schedule that allows students to keep their jobs while going to school. ITESM works with companies to sponsor their online high school program; sponsoring companies provide internet access, computers and other incentives for youth. However, in many cases students are unable to complete online courses because because they are not provided with the necessary training in digital literacy and/or they experience other barriers to learning. A lack of equipment and infrastructure and geographical isolation introduce additional challenges. ITESM is working with the SJRK project to source and develop online resources to meet the needs of students, and particularly those with learning differences, in order to support their access to online education.

			<u>SMARTlab/ Inclusive Design Research Centre of Ireland at UCD</u><br />
			SMARTlab/ Inclusive Design Research Centre of Ireland at UCD is targeting young people with learning differences in environments outside of formal education systems in Rwanda, in order to understand the interactions among young people with learning differences, aspects of their day to day life, and their participation in society including education and youth organisations. Through informal interviews and questionnaires, data is being gathered from both young people with learning differences and the organisations that work with them.
		</p>
		<p>
			This work will help to understand the level of application or use of inclusive design methods in youth organisation programmes and decision making processes. Knowledge of how young people understand and define learning difference is also being gathered through this process. The questionnaires will also guide the preparation of co-design workshops aimed at developing and gathering digital resources to support the unique learning needs of youth with learning differences in Rwanda.
