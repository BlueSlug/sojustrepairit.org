						"El planeta es la escuela" es el proyecto que lidera la Fundaci&oacute;n Karisma en el que participan grupos de j&oacute;venes en Fresno (Tolima) y Medell&iacute;n, (Antioquia)
					</p>
					<p>
						El objetivo es generar experiencias que fortalezcan la relaci&#xF3;n entre los j&#xF3;venes y su territorio, a trav&#xE9;s de dos estrategias:
						<ol>
							<li>Explorar oportunidades para crear o innovar en el territorio.</li>
							<li>Elaborar relatos personales o colectivos (en diferentes formatos como dibujo, fotograf&#xED;as, videos y textos) que den cuenta de las experiencias que est&#xE1;n viviendo los j&#xF3;venes desde su propio punto de vista.</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p>Para el escritor colombiano William Ospina, es urgente que los procesos educativos tengan un prop&#xF3;sito que no se reduzca al &#xE9;xito y la rentabilidad individual, sino que consuele un sentido profundo de dignidad y de comunidad. Algo que solo se alcanza en la educaci&#xF3;n, si se le da lugar al pensamiento, la creatividad, la comunicaci&#xF3;n, la socializaci&#xF3;n y la felicidad. En resumen, si el &#x22;Planeta es la escuela&#x22; nuestra tarea es aprender, innovar y narrar el territorio.</p>
					<p>El proyecto se desarrollar&#xE1; con dos grupos: las mujeres j&#xF3;venes del &#x201C;Festival Motivando a la Gyal&#x201D; de Platohedro (Medell&#xED;n) y un grupo de estudiantes de grados 9, 10 y 11 del Colegio Real Campestre (Mireya y Las Mar&#xED;as, Fresno)
					</p>
					<p>En abril, los j&#xF3;venes del colegio realizaron una serie de entrevistas a habitantes de Fresno que actualmente tienen negocios relacionados con temas en los que manifestaron tener inter&#xE9;s, como turismo, fincas ecol&#xF3;gicas, mec&#xE1;nica, etc. Entre abril y mayo trabajar&#xE1;n con un grupo de artistas para transformar las memorias de esas entrevistas en nuevas narrativas usando im&#xE1;genes, dibujos y creando cuentos o cr&#xF3;nicas. </p>
					<p>En mayo de 2018, ambos grupos compartirán un taller de 3 días en la ciudad de Medell&#xED;n con el objetivo de crear nuevas redes de colaboración entre los participantes y tener la oportunidad de compartir experiencias, historias y retos desde diferentes perspectivas en relación con las preguntas sobre sus territorios. El taller se llevará a cabo en Platohedro.</p>

						"The planet is the school" is the project led by the Karisma Foundation with groups of young people in Fresno (Tolima) and Medell&#xED;n, (Antioquia).
					</p>
					<p>
						The goal is to generate experiences that strengthen the relationship between young people and their territory, through two strategies:
						<ol>
							<li>Explore opportunities to create or innovate in the territory.
							</li>
							<li>
								Elaborate personal or collective stories to tell experiences from their own point of view, using different kinds of supports like drawings, photos, video and written text.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					<p>
						For the Colombian writer William Ospina, it is urgent that the educational processes have a purpose that is not reduced to individual success and profitability, but rather encouraging a deep sense of dignity and community. Something that can only be achieved in education if critical thinking, creativity, communication, socialization and happiness are part of the process. In summary, if the "Planet is the school" our task is to learn, innovate and narrate the territory.
					</p>
					<p>
						The project will be developed with two groups: the young women of the "Festival Motivando a la Gyal" from Platohedro (Medell&#xED;n) and a group of high school students from the Real Campestre School (Mireya and Las Marías, Fresno)
					</p>
					<p>
						In April the students at the school conducted a series of interviews with people in Fresno running businesses related to the interests that they identified in the first part of the project, including tourism, eco-farms, mechanics, etc. The students are now working with a group of artists to transform the memories of the interviews into new narratives, including images, drawings and stories.
					</p>
					<p>
						In May 2018, both groups will participate in a three days workshop in Medell&#xED;n together with project partners from Karisma and IDRC. The purpose of this activity is to create new networks of collaboration between the project participants, and to have the opportunity to exchange experiences, stories and challenges from different perspectives. The workshop will take place on site at Platohedro, one of the Colombian partners of The planet is the school project.

		<h4 class="sjrk-activities-content-header">TakingITGlobal</h4>
		<p>
			TakingITGlobal (TIG) is developing a Guide to Inclusive organizing for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Guide to Action on the SDGs will build on TIG's 7 existing <a href="https://www.tigweb.org/action-tools/guide/">Guides to Action</a>, with a specific focus on inclusive design principles for youth led projects. This guide is being developed as a stand alone resource and also as an embedded element to strengthen inclusive outcomes for two national programs:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://risingyouth.ca/">#RisingYouth</a>, an initiative to support youth led community development initiatives awarding over $1 million in grants.</li>
				<li>Create to Learn, which is providing capacity building for youth from 40 Indigenous communities to foster media making and digital skills.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Designing, testing and piloting these toolkits and their associated activities with integration into program delivery enables participatory community collaboration and in built audiences to engage across the design process.
		</p>
		<p>
			The SJRK team will work with TIG to support the development of Inclusive Design content. It will be published in accessible PDF format and tested through community gatherings and workshop delivery across Canada.
		</p>
		<p>
			Digital media created by Indigenous youth about their communities will be featured on Whose.land, an interactive educational platform and mobile app providing an authentic audience for their work.
		</p>
		<p>
			TIG will also be connecting and sharing best practices of inclusive design across a national coalition of partners working on youth service and exploring the integration of the SJRK storytelling tool into Create to Learn and the <a href="http://decarbonize.tigweb.org/">#Decarbonize/Decolonize</a> initiative.

		<p>
			SMARTlab PhD student Aniyamuzaala James Rwampigi carried out a study in Rwanda from November to December 2017 to find out the mismatches between young people with learning difference and Rwanda’s formal education system was carried out from November to December 2017 in Kigali City and Musanze District. The study interviewed 17 young people between the age of 18 to 30 years old. While some young people worked in household commodity markets, bus terminals, security guards and gate keepers, arts and crafts, and tailoring. Others were farmers in rural areas rearing cows, goats, growing food and cash crops. The aim of the study was to analyze the mismatch between young people with learning differences and formal learning system in Rwanda to come up with recommendations which contribute to matching the mismatch.
		</p>
		<p>
			The study found out the following: Rwanda, a central African landlocked country is recovering from the 1994 Genocide. The Rwanda vision 2020 agenda focuses on empowering and improving the livelihoods of all people including young people with learning differences. However, Rwanda is faced with some challenges including low levels of income among people and mismatches between young people with learning differences and the formal learning and education system.
		</p>
		<p>
			The study established the following challenges: High dropout of young people with learning differences in secondary and higher education; The dropouts for young men in primary and secondary schools are higher than the drop-outs of young women; The drop out of young women in higher education is higher than that of young men. The causes of dropout range from low levels of income; lack of scholastic materials; inaccessible school environments; lack of inclusive resources and learning materials; family breaks up and others. The girl child education policy and other girl initiatives have contributed to supporting girls to complete primary and secondary schools thus dropouts of girls are lower than dropouts of boys.
		</p>
		<p>
			The study found out that when young people drop out of school, majority end up in informal sector jobs. These jobs include: working as security guards in homes of middle class workers; carrying food commodities and language in markets, working in bus parks and terminals to direct passengers; selling nuts and other food items in the cities and busy areas such as bus parks; buying and selling beans and other food commodities; tailoring and knitting and among others. Young people do these jobs for survival and not by choice and they are in search for second chance to acquire skills and knowledge and support in form of capital to start their own businesses and improve their livelihood.
		</p>
		<p>
			The report found out that over 70% of the targeted young people had phones and approximately 94% had used Mobile money services, social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook and e-mails. 58% of the young people at time of interviews where not using the social media because the phones that smart use of social media were damaged or lost.
		</p>
		<p>
			The study recommends the development of inclusive platforms, spaces, Guides and tools that facilitate participation of young women and girls in the development processes and programmes at all levels. Building working networks of diverse young people working together towards a common goal of inclusion and improvement of livelihood for all can be one of strategies to facilitate peer to peer learning and strengthening capacity. Advocacy for inclusive girl child policies and initiatives which take into consideration the voices and needs of young women with learning differences should be prioritized.
		</p>
		<p>
			The research study initiated a basic training on how to develop a business plan as an outcome from interaction with majority of young people. Follow up should be made to develop a youth friendly inclusive business development plan trainings and materials. A basic training was provided but a more comprehensive training contextualized to the needs of young people with learning differences should be developed. Exchange programmes and platforms could tap into this aspect to enable young people to share on how to manage your business and how you develop a business plan for your business.
		</p>
		<p>
			Inclusive design trainings for youth organizations, youth cooperatives and young people with learning differences should be carried out to establish a culture of inclusive practices and inclusion of all categories of young people with learning differences in design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes at all levels.Guide should be developed to support these youth organisations to practice inclusion and facilitate accessibility for all.
		</p>
		<p>
			The full study will be made available soon.

		<h4 class="sjrk-activities-content-header">Inclusive Design Research Centre (IDRC)</h4>
		<p>
			The IDRC has been working on the <a href="https://stories.floeproject.org/">development of a digital storytelling tool</a> that will provide a forum for the gathering and sharing of stories created by youth with learning differences and others involved in social justice action. This tool will allow for creative, multi-modal story authoring and storytelling, including language translation options.
		</p>
		<p>
			Through feedback collected during the story gathering process the tool will be co-designed with the youth that use it. In one example, the IDRC will be heading to Medell&#xED;n, Colombia in May to participate in workshops at <a href="http://platohedro.org/">Platohedro</a>, together with organisers of the upcoming Motivating the Gyal festival (taking place in September 2018 - <a href="http://platohedro.org/tag/motivando-a-la-gyal/">see 2017 festival info here</a>). The Storytelling tool will be used at the workshops in May to gather and share individual and collective stories behind the festival, and to provide "behind the scenes" documentation and a festival blog. Feedback about the tool will be gathered from participants.
