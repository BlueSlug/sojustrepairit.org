            <strong>The goal</strong> of this project is to help youth movements and social justice initiatives to:</p>
            <ul class="sjrk-list">
                <li>become welcoming environments for youth with learning differences, and</li>
                <li>benefit from the advantages of inclusive design.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>The project</strong> will provide a hub:</p>
            <ul class="sjrk-list">
                <li>with toolkits, applications and examples</li>
                <li>to share, repurpose and reuse resources.</li>
            </ul>

        <strong>The kit</strong> will be openly available to any group or individual hosting youth movements, youth action events and social justice movements.
