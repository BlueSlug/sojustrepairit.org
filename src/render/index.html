<h2>About</h2>
<p>
<strong>The goal</strong> of this project is to help youth movements and social justice initiatives to:</p>
<ul class="sjrk-list">
    <li>become welcoming environments for youth with learning differences, and</li>
    <li>benefit from the advantages of inclusive design.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The project</strong> will provide a hub:</p>
<ul class="sjrk-list">
    <li>with toolkits, applications and examples</li>
    <li>to share, repurpose and reuse resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>The kit</strong> will be openly available to any group or individual hosting youth movements, youth action events and social justice movements.
