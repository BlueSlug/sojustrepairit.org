        <strong>The goal</strong> of this project is to help youth movements and social justice initiatives to:
    </p>
    <ul class="sjrk-list">
        <li>become welcoming environments for youth with learning differences, and</li>
        <li>benefit from the advantages of inclusive design.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>The project</strong> will provide a hub:
    </p>
    <ul class="sjrk-list">
        <li>with toolkits, applications and examples</li>
        <li>to share, repurpose and reuse resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>The kit</strong> will be openly available to any group or individual hosting youth movements, youth action events and social justice movements.
